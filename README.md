# The WPM Analyser is an engaging and interactive typing test 
# that measures a user's typing speed and efficiency, expressed
# as words per minute (WPM). It provides real-time feedback on
# accuracy by highlighting correct and incorrect text, categorizes
# users based on conventional typing norms, and offers
# personalized insights for improvement.

## Technologies Used

1. Programming Language: Python

Python is widely recognized for its
simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries. Its support for the
curses library makes it an ideal choice for creating text-based
terminal applications like the WPM Analyser.

2. Library: curses

The curses library facilitates the
creation of terminal-based applications with enhanced text
formatting, real-time input handling, and dynamic content
updates. It is lightweight and perfectly suited for a project that
requires real-time updates like a typing test.

3. Random Module (Python Built-In)

The random module is used to
randomly select typing prompts from a file, ensuring variety
and unpredictability in the tests.

4. File Handling (open function in Python)

Used to read typing prompt texts from
an external file, making the application modular and allowing
easy updates to the database of typing texts.

5. Hardware: Standard Computer or Laptop

The project is designed to run on any
system with a terminal, requiring no specialized hardware. A
standard keyboard and monitor are all that is needed to use
the WPM Analyser.

6. Software: Terminal and Python Environment

Terminals provide a simple, accessible
interface for running Python-based terminal applications.
Python can be installed easily on most operating systems,
ensuring wide compatibility.
